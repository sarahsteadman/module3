# Overview

This is a simple game that allows the user to control a kitty box. The kitty will collide with various objects but can move over the open areas of the map.

This game was created to help me explore Unity as well as the basics of 2D Top-Down game mechanics. I was able to learn about creating objects, using sprites, and programming movement.
